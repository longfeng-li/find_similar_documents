# find_similar_documents
Given millions of documents, we need to find similar documents. if we compare every two documents literally, it will waste lots of time. I used a good method from a paper. It help us save lots of time, because it removes lots of comparison.
The main purpose of this project is to use cloud computing. We upload our project to Commet (cluster) and let it help us to do parallel computing.
